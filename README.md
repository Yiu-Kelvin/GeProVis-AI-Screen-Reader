# Gemini Pro Vision AI Screen Reader
Experience the magic of Gemini Pro Vision AI Screen Reader in this thrilling video. We've turbocharged the traditional Google ChromeVox Screen Reader with the mighty power of Google Gemini Pro Vision. Our mission? To tackle the challenge of web image information access for those with visual impairments.

The problem being addressed is the inability of visually impaired individuals to access image information due to the lack of adherence to W3C web accessibility initiatives by websites. Currently, over 80% of websites lack meaningful alternate text for their images. Moreover, it is unfeasible to retroactively add descriptive text to all existing websites manually.

## Architecture 

Frontend: This project enhances the open-source screen reader, Google ChromeVox Classic, which serves as an extension to the Google Chrome browser. The extension module employs Javascript.

Backend: The backend incorporates the Google Gemini Pro Vision API via the Google cloud function. This API generates descriptive text for images received in either URL or base64 format. The default language for this text is English, although this can be altered by supplying the 'lang' parameter. The text generated by the Gemini API is then sent to the Google Translation API for translation into the selected language, and then returned to the frontend. The cloud functions are developed by Python.

The utilization of ChromeVox Classic screen reader, Cloud Function, and Google Gemini Pro Vision is prevalent. ChromeVox Classic is favored due to its comprehensive functionality and widespread acclaim. Cloud Function is employed owing to its adaptability, ready-to-use environment, superior scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Lastly, Gemini Pro Vision is chosen due to its prowess as the most potent AI model capable of describing an image in a split second, API-based, and its low usage cost.
