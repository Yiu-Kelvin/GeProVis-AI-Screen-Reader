# Gemini Pro Vision AI Screen Reader
Experience the magic of Gemini Pro Vision AI Screen Reader in this thrilling video. We've turbocharged the traditional Google ChromeVox Screen Reader with the mighty power of Google Gemini Pro Vision. Our mission? To tackle the challenge of web image information access for those with visual impairments.

The problem being addressed is the inability of visually impaired individuals to access image information due to the lack of adherence to W3C web accessibility initiatives by websites. Currently, over 80% of websites lack meaningful alternate text for their images. Moreover, it is unfeasible to retroactively add descriptive text to all existing websites manually.

## Architecture 

Frontend: This project enhances the open-source screen reader, Google ChromeVox Classic, which serves as an extension to the Google Chrome browser. The extension module employs Javascript.

Backend: The **Google Gemini Pro Vision API** is a powerful tool that supports multimodal prompts, allowing you to include text, images, and videos in your requests. It generates descriptive text for images received in either URL or base64 format. The default language for this text is English, but you can alter it by supplying the 'lang' parameter. The API incorporates the following components:

1. **Backend**: The backend incorporates the Google Gemini Pro Vision API via the Google cloud function. This API generates descriptive text for images received in either URL or base64 format. The default language for this text is English, although this can be altered by supplying the 'lang' parameter. The text generated by the Gemini API is then sent to the Google Translation API for translation into the selected language and then returned to the frontend.

2. **Cloud Functions**: The cloud functions are developed using Python. Google Cloud API Gateway protects the cloud function for API Key authentication and rate limiting.

3. **Google Cloud Datastore**: This contains three kinds: ApiKey, Caption, and Usage.
   - **ApiKey**: Matches an API key to a User ID.
   - **Caption**: Saves image hash to caption, which is a cache to skip AI calls for the same image.
   - **Usage**: Records usage for each user, including the cost.
   
The utilization of ChromeVox Classic screen reader, Cloud Function, and Google Gemini Pro Vision is prevalent. ChromeVox Classic is favored due to its comprehensive functionality and widespread acclaim. Cloud Function is employed owing to its adaptability, ready-to-use environment, superior scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Lastly, Gemini Pro Vision is chosen due to its prowess as the most potent AI model capable of describing an image in a split second, API-based, and its low usage cost.

## Setup procedure

### Frontend:
1. Follow [original instruction](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:docs/windows_build_instructions.md) to checkout and build ChromeVox Classic
2. Copy and replace all sources under [chromevoxclassic/](chromevoxclassic) to the chromium source under the path ui/accessibility/extensions/chromevoxclassic/
3. After building the ChromeVox Classic browser extension, install the extension under Chrome browser with developer mode turned on
4. Install with "Load unpacked"; the language of generated image description can be configured from the manifest.json by setting the lang code to the attribute "tts_locale", please refer [here](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages) for supported language codes
5. The cloud function URL can be configured via the attribute "gemini_api" from the manifest.json
6. Reinstall the browser extension after modifying the manifest.json

### Backend: 
#### Manual
This is quick R&D without authenication and rate limit. 
1. Create a new Google Cloud Function, with settings: 2nd gen, memory >= 512 MB, and allow all traffic
2. Copy and replace all sources under [google_cloudfunction/](google_cloudfunction) to your Cloud Function 

#### Production Deplolyment
It includes API Gateway and implements rate limit for each API Key. Fork this repo and create a Codespace.

##### Login your GCP account
```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

##### Create GCP resources
```
./deploy.sh 
```
Record down the output api-url, project-id, and service-name.

##### Enable the API

```
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project <project-id>
gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project <project-id>
gcloud services enable <service-name>
```
If you omit to enable API, you will get "PERMISSION_DENIED: API xxxx.apigateway.gemini-screen-reader.cloud.goog is not enabled for the project.".

#### Admin Tools
A set of Python scripts for API key management in admin_tools folder.

###### Before using admin tools
```
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project gemini-screen-reader
gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project gemini-screen-reader
```

1. Rename Namelist_template.xlsx to Namelist.xlsx, add maximum 500 users to the excel.
2. Update admin_tools/config.py.
4. run ```./setup.sh```
3. run ```source venv/bin/activate```
